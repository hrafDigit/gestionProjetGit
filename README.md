[PREMIER COUPLET]
Wanna love you and treat you right
I wanna love you
Every day and every night
We'll be together
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah
For Jah provide the bread

Is this love, is this love, is this love, is this love that I'm feelin'?
Is this love, is this love, is this love, is this love that I'm feelin'?

Ooh
